# FoenixIDE

Development and Debugging Suite for the Foenix F256jr-family of Computers.

This is a virtual mc6809 powered computer. It is intended to be used as a software development tool and learning platform for assembly language and BASIC programming. The software will be released with an open source license and may be used for whatever purpose you want, including personal projects, education, and commercial use.

The F256jr is loosely based around the concept of the world's most popular computer, the Commodore 64. When you turn on the system, you see a BASIC screen, with the READY prompt. You can type in BASIC commands, enter programs, or load programs from disk, tape or cartridge.

The FoenixIDE attempt to replicate this experience on a modern computer: you will be able to write and run BASIC programs, assembler programs, and save programs to disk to trade with other people. The FoenixIDE features a 40-column text screen, several different graphic resolutions, and the ability to communicate with hardware and other computers through a virtual modem.

The FoenixIDE is a work in progress.

The Foenix F256jr and its associated materials are owned by Stefany Allaire.

The FoenixIDE looks for kernel.hex and kernel.lst files in the ROMs folder collocated with the executable.  Obtain the Kernel from the sister repository: https://github.com/Trinity-11/Kernel_FMX
